# GameFinder

This is the GitHub Repository for the GameFinder App that our group was developing using Agile practices. Our team consisted of Jeremy Grimmer, Justinn Ziegler, and Peter Kline. We first discussed what it was that we wanted to accomplish, and transformed these ideas into User Stories. After writing all of our User Stories, we then created tasks for each story. We created a new branch in GitHub for each task, and then completed the tasks and pushed our code back to the Develop Branch. Each User Story had a list of acceptance criteria that had to be met in order to fully close the ticket. A few times, we realized that we might not have fully met the acceptance criteria, so we went back on that ticket and fixed the issues to complete the task. At the very end, we created a debugging ticket and smoothed everything out to get our API endpoints fully functioning. We were able to complete 12 of our 20 total tickets.

Many of these User Stories were created as stretch goals, so we did not intend on completing them. We also included one epic that could be broken down into smaller tasks for future work on the Application.

# Code

We worked on a Web API that allowed a user to create different Games, Game Consoles, and Game Genres for a database. The user can enter certain properties for each of these items, and they will be stored in tables in the database. We also included foreign keys to link each game to a specific Genre or Game Console, and each Genre and Game Console included a list of games inside. We created API endpoints that allow the user to view all of these genres, view all of the consoles, or view specific games based on entry criteria. All of the necessary data will show up to the user and allow them to view specific games in whatever way they want to.

# Division of Labor

Jeremy was the GitMaster, so he created the GitHub Repo. We all collectively created and wrote down the User Stories, as well as the tasks for each User Story. We worked together to decide which tasks we could complete, and we assigned them all Fibonacci Ratings. In the end, Justinn completed tasks 1, 6, and 9. Jeremy completed tasks 3, 5, and 8. Peter completed tasks 2, 4, 10, and 11 (12 was a side project that we did not discuss doing together, but Peter just added it at the end). We all worked together to debug the Web API and make sure that the endpoints were working, and Peter created the debugging ticket to fix these errors.
